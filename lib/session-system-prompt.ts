/**
 * `SYSTEM.md` / `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` resolution for omp-web sessions.
 *
 * The `omp` CLI resolves both files before it creates a session — project-local
 * first (`.omp/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`), then user-level
 * (`~/.omp/agent/`, …) — and hands the text to `createAgentSession` as
 * `customSystemPrompt` / `appendSystemPrompt`. omp-web builds its own session
 * options in `lib/rpc-manager.ts`, so a browser session used to silently drop
 * every prompt file the same user gets in the terminal (issue #28).
 *
 * The lookup itself is omp's own `findConfigFile`, not a re-implementation, so
 * the config roots and their precedence cannot drift from the CLI's. Two things
 * differ, both forced by serving many projects from one process:
 *
 * - The CLI resolves against `getProjectDir()`, i.e. the directory `omp` was
 *   started in. Here every lookup is bound to the session's own cwd.
 * - Project-local prompt files come from whatever repository the browser
 *   opened, so `lib/project-trust.ts` is in scope. They load for untrusted
 *   projects too, deliberately: they are data folded into the system prompt —
 *   the same category as skills, rules and `AGENTS.md`, which the trust gate
 *   leaves alone — and the gate exists for code omp *imports and executes*.
 *   They are a prompt-injection surface exactly as they are in the CLI; see
 *   `docs/project-trust.md`.
